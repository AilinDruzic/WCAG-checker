What is WCAG-Checker?

WCAG-Checker is a tool for analyzing and evaluating the accessibility of websites based on the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). It helps developers and designers ensure that their websites are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.

How does it work?

1. The user provides a URL to a website.
2. The tool fetches the HTML code of the provided page.
3. Using axe-core, it runs an analysis to detect accessibility issues such as:
- Contrast issues
- Incorrect heading structure
- Missing alt texts for images
- Missing or incorrect ARIA attributes
  
4. The results are clearly presented in three categories:
   
- Violations: Issues that need to be fixed.
- Passes: Accessibility rules that are satisfied.
- Inapplicable: Rules that do not apply to the current page.
